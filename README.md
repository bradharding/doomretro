*DOOM Retro* is the classic, refined *DOOM* source port for Windows & Linux PC. It represents how I like my *DOOM* to be today, in all its dark and gritty, unapologetically pixelated glory. I have strived to craft a unique ensemble of compelling features, while always respecting that classic, nostalgic *DOOM* experience many of us still hold dear.
